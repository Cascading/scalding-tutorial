# Scalding Tutorial Project

## Introduction

This is Twitter's [tutorial] [tutorial] for [Scalding] [scalding] adapted to run
on Hadoop as a standalone job - i.e. without requiring `scald.rb` etc.

This was built as a Scala SBT project by the [Concurrent Inc] [concurrent] team,
in order to integrate the scalding tutorial into the [Cascading SDK][sdk].  It
is based on the excellent work done by [Snowplow Analytics][snowplow] for
porting the [`Wordcount example`][wordcount] to SBT.

The versioning of the project follows the versions of the scalding release on
which it is based.

Please note that this tutorial uses scala 2.10 and not 2.9.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this tutorial, you need to have `SBT` and the `hadoop` command
installed. Cascading and therefore scalding is compatible with a number of
hadoop distributions. If you are unsure, if your distribution is compatible,
please check the [compatibility][compatibility] page.

You do not need to have a full hadoop cluster, in order to run this tutorial.
The local mode of hadoop is sufficient.


## Building

Assuming you already have SBT installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/Cascading/scalding-tutorial.git
    $ cd scalding-tutorial
    $ sbt assembly

The 'fat jar' is now available as:

    target/scalding-tutorial-0.8.11.jar

## Project structure

Some modifications have been done to the code, order to properly work in an SBT
based build.

* all code is now in `src/main/scala/tutorial`
* the data files for the different parts live now in `data`
* the classes in the matrix tutorial have been renamed to match the file names,
  so that the commandline invocation is similar to the original tutorial
* the documentation of the examples has been adapted to match the new structure

## Running the examples

Each part of the tutorial explains, how to run it properly. However the general
way is always

    $ yarn jar target/scalding-tutorial-0.8.11.jar <TutorialPart> --local <addtional arguments>

If you want to run the examples on a Hadoop clsuter, replace `--local` with
`--hdfs`.
