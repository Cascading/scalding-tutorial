# Scalding Example Project

## Introduction

This is Twitter's [`WordCountJob`] [wordcount] example for [Scalding] [scalding] adapted to run on Hadoop as a standalone job - i.e. without requiring `scald.rb` etc.

This was built as a Scala SBT project by the [SnowPlow Analytics] [snowplow] team, as a proof of concept for porting our ETL jobs to Scalding to run on [Amazon Elastic MapReduce] [emr].

## Building

Assuming you already have SBT installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/scalding-example-project.git
    $ cd scalding-example-project
    $ sbt assembly

The 'fat jar' is now available as:

    target/scalding-example-project-0.0.1.jar

## Unit testing

The `assembly` command above runs the test suite - but you can also run this manually with:

    $ sbt test
    <snip>
    [info] + A WordCount job should
	[info]   + count words correctly
	[info] Passed: : Total 2, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 2, Skipped 0

## Running on Amazon EMR

First, upload the jar to S3 - if you haven't yet built the project (see above), you can grab the latest copy of the jar from this repo's [Downloads] [downloads].

Next, upload the data file [`data/hello.txt`] [hello-txt] to S3.

Finally, you are ready to run this job using the [Amazon Ruby EMR client] [emr-client]:

    $ elastic-mapreduce --create --name "scalding-example-project" \
      --jar s3n://{{JAR_BUCKET}}/scalding-example-project-0.0.1.jar \
      --arg com.snowplowanalytics.hadoop.scalding.WordCountJob \
      --arg --hdfs \
      --arg --input --arg s3n://{{IN_BUCKET}}/hello.txt \
      --arg --output --arg s3n://{{OUT_BUCKET}}/results

Replace `{{JAR_BUCKET}}`, `{{IN_BUCKET}}` and `{{OUT_BUCKET}}` with the appropriate paths.

## Checking your results

Once the output has completed, you should see a folder structure like this in your output bucket:

     results
     |
     +- _SUCCESS
     +- part-00000

Download the `part-00000` file and check that it contains:

	goodbye	1
	hello	1
	world	2

## Troubleshooting

If you are trying to run this on a non-Amazon EMR environment, you may need to edit:

    project/BuildSettings.scala

And comment out the Hadoop jar exclusions:

    // "hadoop-core-0.20.2.jar", // Provided by Amazon EMR. Delete this line if you're not on EMR
    // "hadoop-tools-0.20.2.jar" // "

## Next steps

Fork this project and adapt it into your own custom Scalding job.

Use the excellent [Elasticity] [elasticity] Ruby library to invoke/schedule your Scalding job on EMR.

## Roadmap

Nothing planned - although it would be nice to upgrade from Specs to Specs2 for the testing, and bump Scala to 2.9.1 at the same time. If you would like to do this, feel free to submit a pull request.
